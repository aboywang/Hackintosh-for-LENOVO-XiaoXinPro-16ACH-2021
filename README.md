## Hackintosh for LENOVO XiaoXinPro 16ACH 2021

##### **attention:**

- This 'EFI' file is only available for **macOS Monterey**,if you need the higher version compared  to Monterey,you must replace the crucial files of the 'EFI',like bluetooth,to ensure your PC could work well;
- IF the temperature of  your laptop's CPU is too high, you probably need to limit it with the 'AMD Power Gadget' application in the Tools folder.
